Hello there, I'm a CS student, mainly using github to archive my old projects.

If you're here from my resume, I perfer to keep my online and professional life seperate, at least for now.
Please respect my privacy and don't share my name with others.
All my projects here will almost certainly be game related because well, that's all I find entertaining to make in my free time.
